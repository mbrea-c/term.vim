# term.vim

```term.vim``` is a vim colorscheme that uses only terminal colors. I created it for use with pywal, since I prefer it to wal.vim.

Credit goes to Noah Frederick for creating noctu.vim, from which this colorscheme is based. I only slightly edited it to add support for certain coc.nvim features.
